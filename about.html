        <strong><h3>My Passions</h3></strong>
        <section style="padding-left: 40px;">
          <p>
            My whole life I have been passionate about video games. Playing them, watching them, and the hard work that goes into creating them. 
            Some of my favorite genres of games are RPGs, simulators, base/city building, and strategy. During a rough patch of mental health, 
            I sought out something I could completely immerse myself in, something that I could look forward to. This is when I was introduced 
            to Critical Role. From the first episode I was hooked. I watched their second campaign first becuase it had just recently started. 
            I would watch at least one episode a day to catch up so I could watch them live every Thursday. I cannot express in words how important 
            and powerful this was to me. Their genuine friendship, and compassion brought me comfort in a time where I was hardly feeling anything. 
            Naturally, I learned the rules of D&D over the course of watching them, and it inspired me to create my own world that my friends and I 
            could share moments like these together. This helped me realize how passionate I was about the power of creation. Creativity is one of 
            the most powerful things in the world, and can help anyone solve the toughest of problems; whether that be a problem is a physical or 
            mental obstacle. So you could say I'm very passionate about the power of creativity, TTRPGs, and Critical Role.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you made it through that word vomit of a ramble, thank you. Now enough about pass times, lets talk about bonds. Having a support 
            system is a necessity, and what better support system is there than my wife, Ren, and our many kiddos. When I say kiddos I mean kiddos 
            with paws of course. As I'm sure you have already seen, we have a lot of pets! Ren working at a vet has led to several foster fails, 
            but I wouldn't consider any of them a wrong decision. Each one of them have their quirks, but the amount of love an animal can hold is 
            unmatched. Without Ren's encouragement and support this website wouldn't even exist! And without my cuddle puddle to keep me company as 
            I write this, I would be cold <!--insert sad emoji here-->. But in all seriousness, each and everyone of them mean the world to me, and 
            I can't imagine life without them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this website will grow and develop as I grow not only professionally, but as a person. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 
            Even if this website grows to be completely different in the future, I know that what I am passionate about will only evolve form here. My 
            passions are what make me, me! And I'm proud to be me! Once again, thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I hope you have a 
            great day/night!
