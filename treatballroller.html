                        <p>
                            Treatball Roller (placeholder name) is a simple casual mobile game where you play as 
                            a dog. The objective is to roll a ball around that holds treats, and collect treats that 
                            fall out. There will be many levels, dogs to choose from, treatballs to choose from, 
                            and more! This game is currently in development, updates will be posted on this page.

                    <strong><h3>Update May 2024</h3></strong>
                    <p>
                        First update! Development started this month on my first game! I'll go over updates to the 
                        game, any set backs I'm facing, and what is planned for next month. If you have any comments, 
                        questions, concerns, or threats I'd love to hear from you! As of right now, I do not have the 
                        contact me page functioning, but once that is complete, feel free to message me through there!
                        <br><br>
                        Now! Onto the fun stuff!
                        <br>
                        New stuff:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Imported dog and ball assets</li>
                            <li>Added movement input to the dog so it can be controlled via WASD</li>
                            <li>Added animations to the dog's movement</li>
                            <li>Added an idle animation to the dog</li>
                            <li>Set up collision physics so the ball moves appropriately when the dog boops it</li>
                            <li>Added a boop animation when the dog runs into the ball nose first</li>
                            <li>Created and imported a cereal treat asset</li>
                            <li>Added FX and floating animation to the cereal treat</li>
                            <li>Added functionality to the treatball that drops a treat ball everytime a point on 
                                the ball creates a collision event with the dog</li>
                            <li>Added a point system to the ball and UI for it on the screen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Set backs and bugs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Had some challenges with the nose boop animation, still not perfect on timing, but 
                                plan on refining it later</li>
                            <li>I had to replace my original treatball asset due to it not importing from Blender 
                                correctly</li>    
                            <li>When I first set up the treat to spawn, it spawned several at a time. This was fixed</li>
                            <li>Stuggled a bit with setting up the UI. Getting it placed on the screen right, 
                                functioning correctly, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        What's nexted:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Title screen with level selection</li>
                            <li>First level design</li>
                            <li>Pause menu with a "Back to Title Page", "Settings", and exit buttons</li>
                            <li>Volume slider in the settings menu (sound and fucntionality to come later)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        That's all I have for now! Got a lot done in the first month, and I am excited to share more 
                        with you! Thank you!
