                        <p>
                            Treatball Roller (placeholder name) is a simple casual game built in Unreal Engine 5
                            where you play as a dog. The objective is to roll a ball around that holds treats, 
                            and collect treats that fall out. There will be many levels, dogs to choose from, 
                            treatballs to choose from, and more! This game is currently in development, updates 
                            will be posted on this page.

                    <strong><h3>Update July 2024</h3></strong>
                    <p>
                        I managed to make a lot of progress over the last month! In addition to the usual updates, I 
                        got some screenshots and a video! Progress is beginning to slow a bit as I start to attempt 
                        more difficult funtionalities, but it is progress nonetheless! If you have any comments, 
                        questions, concerns, or threats I'd love to hear from you! As of right now, I do not have the 
                        contact me page functioning, but once that is complete, feel free to message me through there!
                        <br><br>
                        Oh boy, here I go updating again!
                        <br><br>
                        New stuff:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added a Title Screen that disappears when clicked</li>
                            <li>Added a menu button in the top right corner of the screen that pauses the game</li>
                            <li>Within that menu are various buttons including settings, return to title, respawn ball 
                                at start, and an X button</li>
                            <li>The settings menu has a non-functional slider to adjust the music that doesn't exist</li>
                            <li>The return to title returns the player to the title screen</li>
                            <li>The respawn ball at start deletes the ball and respawns it where the level began (in 
                                case of it disappearing or getting stuck)</li>
                            <li>The X button, you guessed it, exits the menu and resumes play</li>
                            <li>I managed to create two levels and start on a third</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Set backs and bugs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>It took me a lot of time trying to figure out the respawn ball feature. I thought this 
                                would be a good idea because while play testing the ball clips through things or gets 
                                stuck in awkward spots.</li>
                            <li>When I go into the Menu for the second time, the Menu button does not delete (so it can 
                                still be seen by the X). This is not as designed and should hide itself while in the Menu.</li>
                            <li>Using the Return to Title button does not have the click to 'Begin Play'</li>
                            <li>I've made a few attempts at importing a human model (owner of the dog), but the material looks 
                                metallic and the model isn't smooth.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        What's next:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fix the above bugs</li>
                            <li>Level selection in the title screen</li>
                            <li>Finish up third level design</li>
                            <li>Succesfully import the Owner model</li>
                            <li>Add music and attach it to the volume slider</li>
                            <li>Stretch goal: add some AI to the Owner  NPC</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        I believe that is everything. I'm happy with how much I got done! See you next time!

                    <strong><h3>Update May/June 2024</h3></strong>
                    <p>
                        First update! Development started this month on my first game! I'll go over updates to the 
                        game, any set backs I'm facing, and what is planned for next month. If you have any comments, 
                        questions, concerns, or threats I'd love to hear from you! As of right now, I do not have the 
                        contact me page functioning, but once that is complete, feel free to message me through there!
                        <br><br>
                        Now! Onto the fun stuff!
                        <br><br>
                        New stuff:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Imported dog and ball assets</li>
                            <li>Added movement input to the dog so it can be controlled via WASD</li>
                            <li>Added animations to the dog's movement</li>
                            <li>Added an idle animation to the dog</li>
                            <li>Set up collision physics so the ball moves appropriately when the dog boops it</li>
                            <li>Added a boop animation when the dog runs into the ball nose first</li>
                            <li>Created and imported a cereal treat asset</li>
                            <li>Added FX and floating animation to the cereal treat</li>
                            <li>Added functionality to the treatball that drops a treat ball everytime a point on 
                                the ball creates a collision event with the dog</li>
                            <li>Added a point system to the ball and UI for it on the screen</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        Set backs and bugs:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Had some challenges with the nose boop animation, still not perfect on timing, but 
                                plan on refining it later</li>
                            <li>I had to replace my original treatball asset due to it not importing from Blender 
                                correctly</li>    
                            <li>When I first set up the treat to spawn, it spawned several at a time. This was fixed</li>
                            <li>Stuggled a bit with setting up the UI. Getting it placed on the screen right, 
                                functioning correctly, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        What's next:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Title screen with level selection</li>
                            <li>First level design</li>
                            <li>Pause menu with a "Back to Title Page", "Settings", and exit buttons</li>
                            <li>Volume slider in the settings menu (sound and fucntionality to come later)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        That's all I have for now! Got a lot done in the first month, and I am excited to share more 
                        with you! Thank you!
